communication between the two entities.

python3 client.py img.jpeg
```


## Communication protocole used
- UDP

The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. 
It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred.

## client . py Script

The client.py should be placed on the client side
It should have the same ip address as the server side.

To change the ip of the script , we need to change the serverAddressPort.

The scripts help to make communications between server and client.

## server. py Script Installation

The server.py should be placed on the server side.

To change the ip of the script , we need to change the serverAddressPort.
